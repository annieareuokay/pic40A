11. Forms
  11.9 actions  
  - inside of the forms (or on specific buttons, etc.), we can specify actions to take
  -the action attribute calls a script - usually some .php script 
  -the onsubmit attribute specifies what to do when a form is submitted 
  -many others exist... More when we discuss JavaScript C:

12. CSS
  12.1 Brief overview
    This is a way to specify EXACTLY how different html elements iwll display in a browser window. 
    All browsers have some default, but we can change how the page is rendered. 

  12.2 Inline
    - specify where the element is created how its contents should be rendered 
    - NOT ADVISABLE if we ever did want to change how these inline specifications render a document. We have to change them individually. (Example below, anyway). 
    - use style attribute:
      style = "property: value; other property: otherValue; "

  12.3 Within document
    - In the head element, we add a style tag. 
      <style> 
        someSelectors{
          properties...
        }

        someOtherSelectors{
        moreProperties...
        }
      </style>

  12.4 External
    - An external file has the same format as what goes inside of the style tag. 
    - We link to the external file with a link element: 
      
      <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="relativeUrl, or URL" media= "all" /> 

      - type: tells the browser we're looking at a CSS file. 
      - rel: says that it is for styling 
      - href: where the CSS code can be found 
      - media: 'all' for all forms of media; 'screen' if just on a computer screen,... 

  12.5 divs and spans
    - Used to segregate or block off chunks of HTML to have a specific format. 
    - divs: by default are stacked - one on top of the other
    - spans: by default are inline - one next to the other

13. Selectors
  13.1 Class (gives context for something):
    .className{
      properties
    }
  13.2 Element:
    elementName{
      properties
    }
  13.3 Id (very specific; should be unique for each element):
    #idName{
      properties separated by ; 
    }
  13.4.1 Specifying Stuff
    - Can be more specific by listing the ids/classes/elements in order: 
      p a .className <--describes all elements with class name of className that are inside of an anchor that is inside of a p

    Consider multiple cases by listing with commas 
    -h2, h3 <-- describes all h2 and h3 elements
