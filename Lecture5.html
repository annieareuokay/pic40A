7. Lists
  7.3 Definition Lists:
    dl tag - semantically used to give a term and its definition
	embedded within the dl element:
	- dt: definition term - the term we want to define
	- dd: description - the description of the term
  
8. Tables:
  8.1 Table tag
    define area that will be a table with <table>...</table>
	thead: tag for the header part of a table - names of columns?
	tbody: bulk of the table and data
	tfoot: row for the sums of the entries or their average
	
  8.2 Headers
    th tag: signifies something is a header/label entry
	
	Sometimes, even the rows have special titles and those titles can
	be placed inside of a th element -- not just for the names of columns
		
	
  8.3 Rows and data
    - each row is enclosed by a row element: tr
	- each data element is inside of a table data element: td
	- if nothing is inside a td or th tag, then the title/data is ""
  
9. Images: 
  9.1 Overview
  
  img tag, self-closing
  
  9.2 src and alt:
    src - source - tells where the image is located and its name
	alt - alternative text - gives a description of the image if not
	found or loaded, and used for the visually impaired
  
  9.3 height and width:
    usually these attributes are measured in pixels, px
	height: the height of the image
	width: the width of the image
	
	If only one is specified then the aspect ratio is maintained.
	Otherwise, we may distort the image.
  
10. Audio and Video
  10.1 audio:
    With the audio element, we can include audio files to play.
	
	There is an attribute that doesn't need to be assigned a value called
	controls - just make sure to include it.
	
	10.1.1
	  source element: <source src="fileName.whatever" />
	  
	  Can include multiple source elements, in case the browser cannot
	  play the preceding file types.
	  
	  Can include an error message if none of the file types can be played.		
  
  10.2 video:
    Same as for audio with the source elements and the controls attribute
  
11. Forms
  11.1 Overview
    A form is an element used to accept user input/requests. Within a form
    there are different ways of accepting user input.
    
  11.2 Submit and Reset
    submit: <type input="submit" value="What Displays on the Button" />
	  - will take the user's input in the form and do something
	  
	reset: <type input="reset" value="What Displays on the Button" />
	  - clears everything from the form
  
  11.3 text:
    - this will accept a user's input in a small text field
	- for this type of button, we want to give the field area a name
	attribute (used for when the data are processed), id (to identify
	the text field).
	
	- label tag:
	  attribute for: value of for should be the id of the form element
	  
	  Used to specify a label.

  11.4 textarea:
    - this is for a lot of text - not just a small amount like with the input type
    of text.

    - can specify attributes of rows and cols, number of rows and columns

    - can give default text by placing text between opening and closing tag.
