			<h2> That awkward moment when I socially interacted</h2> 
			<p>
				<b>O</b>nce upon a time, a very awkward human named Annie Le was born. She was so awkward, that people in her high school gave her the name <strong>"Awkward Annie"</strong>. Being the very socially inept, awkward kid she was, Annie wore that name with pride. Finally, she was being recognized. However, it finally dawned on her that wearing that name like a badge became a detriment to her, because people never saw her beyond her awkwardness. <i>I'm so misunderstood</i>, the pathetic human thought. Eventually graduation happened, and the last impression Annie ever left was her awkwardness. The name followed her until college, and tt wasn't until then did she decide to make a drastic change in her life. She was finally going to get rid of the one thing that she believed was bringing down her coolness: her beloved bowl cut that she fashioned for 18 years of her awkward life. She thought, <i>Enough! I will get rid of this bowl cut and maybe finally people will finally notice me for me, and not as Awkward Annie.</i> </p>
				<p>After waiting nearly a year, Annie managed to emerge from her awkward cuccoon and become the new and improved, bang-less, coconut-headedlessness Annie with semi-medium-length hair. Or so she thought. Sure she didn't have a bowl cut anymore, and sure she could rate herself a solid 6/10 on the attractive scale now, but she was still very, very awkward and very lost and lonely. </p> 
				<p>But what is there to do? <u>Nothing.</u> She realized that she can't change who she is, but in fact, learn to embrace it. Today, Annie is 22 years old and still living with her parents. She never learned how to socialize.</p>

			<h2> Some ramblings. 
			</h2> 
			<p> Loren ipsum--Am I supposed to write anything more in this? Cuz I'm very confused. I guess this where I just type out gibberish until something happens. Ok sounds good. Will this end up at the new line? Who knows. I guess we'll find out. 
			</p>

				Ok good. It did the thing. I don't know what I'm doing tbh. I'm supposed to think of an interesting story but all i can think about are men. (lolol) I think this is another paragraph. Oh look. Here's some <i> italicizations </i>. But over here I'm putting <em> emphasis </em>. This semantic stuff is really confusing. Lol it's okay. I guess I should write more about it to fill up space. How many more elements do I need? 2 more? <strong> Ok. </strong> Wait. Make that <u>one</u> more. ALRIGHT I'm done now. It's 3:30 am. I need to sleep. Thank you, homework. </p>
				<p>
					Actually I'm just gonna make this third paragraph to make it seem like I'm taking up space on this page. But I really don't know what to write here. I'm very sleep deprived. You're doing great, Annie. I must be crazy to think I can turn this homework in as is.
